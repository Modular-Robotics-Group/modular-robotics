# Modular Robotics Simulation

This repository hosts a set of tools which can be used to simulate modular robot reconfiguration.
Example use cases include:

- Finding the shortest path from an initial configuration to a desired configuration
- Analyzing and comparing the effectiveness of different models (ex: sliding vs pivoting)
- Determining if a configuration is "super-rigid"

## Usage

This section briefly describes how to find a shortest path between two configurations.
For more specific information about each step of the process, see the relevant tools [wiki page](https://github.com/gShahr/modular-robotics/wiki).

1. Set up initial and desired configurations using the [3D Tiler](https://Modular-Robotics-Group.github.io/modular-robotics/3DTiler/Index.html).
2. Run [Pathfinder](https://github.com/Modular-Robotics-Group/modular-robotics/wiki/Pathfinder) with the configurations.
3. Visualize the generated path in [WebVis](https://Modular-Robotics-Group.github.io/modular-robotics/WebVis/index.html).

## Install

Both the 3D Tiler and WebVis are web applications, and as such do not need to be installed unless
you need a local modified version. The process for building and running Pathfinder is described
[here](https://github.com/Modular-Robotics-Group/modular-robotics/wiki/Pathfinder#compiling).

## Modular Robotics Web Tool

Modular Robotics Web Tool (MRWT) has two modes: viewer and painter mode. Viewer mode helps validate paths found using Pathfinder by animating the sequence of moves found. Painter mode allows us to plan out possible configurations in the MRWT.

## Pathfinder

Pathfinder will find the shortest path between two configurations, if such a path exists.

## 3DTiler

3DTiler can be used to set up configurations for modular robots, plan out possible configurations,
or just make stuff out of cubes (or rhombic dodecahedra).
